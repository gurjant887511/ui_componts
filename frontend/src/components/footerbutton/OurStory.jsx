      <p className="mb-4">
        UI Inventory was created with one clear mission — to make stylish, modern, and reusable UI components easily accessible for developers and designers.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        In today’s fast-paced development world, great UI is not just about looks. It’s about speed, consistency, and clean code. UI Inventory was built to solve this exact problem by providing components that are ready to use and easy to customize.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">Our library allows you to:</p>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>View live previews of components before using them</li>
        <li>Access clean, well-structured code</li>
        <li>Use many components completely free of cost</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Every component in UI Inventory is carefully designed to help you build professional and visually appealing interfaces without wasting time rewriting the same UI again and again.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        UI Inventory is more than just a component library — it’s a growing collection built to support creativity, productivity, and modern web development.
      </p>
